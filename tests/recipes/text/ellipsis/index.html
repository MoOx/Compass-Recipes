<p class="doc">Properly cutting off multi-line text is a surprisingly hard thing to do well.</p>
<ul>
    <li>overflow: hidden provides no indication of the text cut off.</li>
    <li>text-overflow: ellipsis works only on single line content.</li>
    <li>Various JavaScript solutions are fragile because they need explicit relayout whenever the box width or content changes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="doc">We can do better with pure CSS and a little imagination</p>

<div class="ellipsis"><div>
    <p>Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago &ndash; never mind how long precisely &ndash; having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation.  Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off &ndash; then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.</p>
